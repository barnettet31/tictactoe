## Goals
Simple pygame project where I build out a tic tac toe simulator 
1. 3x3 grid
2. 2 player game 
3. Game plays while there is no winner
4. Clicking checks grid item to see if it's checked and wiggles screen if it's not available but fills in square if it is 
5. Winning launches pop up that says the winner name and a prompt to reset the game state
